# What is Random Beans ?

Random Beans is a library that generates random Java beans. Let's say you have a class `Person` and you want to generate a random instance of it, here we go:

```java
Person person = random(Person.class);
```

The static method `EnhancedRandom.random` is able to generate random instances of a given type.

Let's see another example. If you want to generate a random stream of 10 persons, you can use the following snippet:

```java
Stream<Person> persons = randomStreamOf(10, Person.class);
```

This second static method of the `EnhancedRandom` API generates a stream of random instances of a given type.

# What is this EnhancedRandom API?

The `java.util.Random` API provides 7 methods to generate random data: `nextInt()`, `nextLong()`, `nextDouble()`, `nextFloat()`, `nextBytes()`, `nextBoolean()` and `nextGaussian()`.
What if you need to generate a random `String`? Or say a random instance of your domain object?
Random Beans provides the `EnhancedRandom` API that extends `java.util.Random` with a method called `nextObject(Class type)`.
This method is able to generate a random instance of any arbitrary Java bean:

```java
EnhancedRandom enhancedRandom = EnhancedRandomBuilder.aNewEnhancedRandom();
Person person = enhancedRandom.nextObject(Person.class);
```

The `EnhancedRandomBuilder` is the main entry point to configure `EnhancedRandom` instances with a fluent API. It allows you to set all
parameters to control how random data is generated:

```java
EnhancedRandom random = EnhancedRandomBuilder.aNewEnhancedRandomBuilder()
   .minCollectionSize(5)
   .maxCollectionSize(10)
   .minStringLength(10)
   .maxStringLength(20)
   .maxObjectPoolSize(100)
   .charset(forName("UTF-8"))
   .dateRange(today, tomorrow)
   .timeRange(nine, five)
   .scanClasspathForConcreteTypes(true)
   .seed(123L)
   .build();
```

For more details about these parameters, please refer to the [configuration parameters](https://github.com/benas/random-beans/wiki/Randomization-parameters) section.

In most cases, default options are enough and you can use a static import of the `EnhancedRandom.random(Class object)` as seen previously.

# Why Random Beans ?

Populating a Java object with random data can look easy at first glance, unless your domain model involves many related classes.
In the previous example, let's suppose the `Person` type is defined as follows:

![](https://github.com/benas/random-beans/raw/master/site/person.png)

**Without** Random Beans, you would write the following code in order to create an instance of the `Person` class:

```java
Street street = new Street(12, (byte) 1, "Oxford street");
Address address = new Address(street, "123456", "London", "United Kingdom");
Person person = new Person("Foo", "Bar", "foo.bar@gmail.com", Gender.MALE, address);
```

And if these classes do not provide constructors with parameters (may be some legacy beans you don't have the control over), you would write:

```java
Street street = new Street();
street.setNumber(12);
street.setType((byte) 1);
street.setName("Oxford street");

Address address = new Address();
address.setStreet(street);
address.setZipCode("123456");
address.setCity("London");
address.setCountry("United Kingdom");

Person person = new Person();
person.setFirstName("Foo");
person.setLastName("Bar");
person.setEmail("foo.bar@gmail.com");
person.setGender(Gender.MALE);
person.setAddress(address);
```

With Random Beans, generating a random `Person` object is done with `random(Person.class)`. The library will **recursively** populate
all the object graph. That's a big difference!
