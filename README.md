# What is Random Beans ?

Random Beans is a library that generates random Java beans.
Generating random data is a common requirement in software testing, and this task can quickly become tedious when the domain model
involves many related classes. Random Beans tries to make this task easier.

# Why Random Beans?

The `java.util.Random` API provides 7 methods to generate random data: `nextInt()`, `nextLong()`, `nextDouble()`, `nextFloat()`, `nextBytes()`, `nextBoolean()` and `nextGaussian()`.
What if you need to generate a random `String`? Or say a random instance of your domain object?
Random Beans provides the `EnhancedRandom` API that extends `java.util.Random` with a method called `nextObject(Class type)`. This method is able to generate a random instance of any arbitrary Java bean:

```java
EnhancedRandom enhancedRandom = EnhancedRandomBuilder.aNewEnhancedRandomBuilder().build();
Person person = enhancedRandom.nextObject(Person.class);
```

The `EnhancedRandomBuilder` is the main entry point to configure `EnhancedRandom` instances with a fluent API. It allows you to set all
parameters to control how random data is generated. In most cases, default options are enough and you can use a static import of the `EnhancedRandom.random(Class object)` method:

```java
Person person = random(Person.class);
```

This snippet will generate a random instance of the `Person` type.

Populating a Java object with random data can look easy at first glance, unless your domain model involves many related classes.
Let's see a quick example, suppose you have the following domain classes:

With Random Beans, generating a random `Person` object is done with the previous snippet. The library will **recursively** populate
all the object graph. **Without** Random Beans, you would write something like:

```java
Street street = new Street(12, (byte) 1, "Oxford street");
Address address = new Address(street, "123456", "London", "United Kingdom");
Person person = new Person("Foo", "Bar", "foo.bar@gmail.com", Gender.MALE, address);
```

And if these classes do not provide constructors with parameters (may be some legacy beans you don't have the control over), you would write:

```java
Street street = new Street();
street.setNumber(12);
street.setType((byte) 1);
street.setName("Oxford street");

Address address = new Address();
address.setStreet(street);
address.setZipCode("123456");
address.setCity("London");
address.setCountry("United Kingdom");

Person person = new Person();
person.setFirstName("Foo");
person.setLastName("Bar");
person.setEmail("foo.bar@gmail.com");
person.setGender(Gender.MALE);
person.setAddress(address);
```

As you can see, Random Beans can tremendously reduce the code of generating random data than doing it by hand.
